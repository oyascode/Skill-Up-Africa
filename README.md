## Polymorphism
Polimorphism is the ability of multiple object types to implement the same functionality. This is best examplified in creation of man. The first man and woman (parent classes) were created with attributes or properties ({hands: 2, brain: True}) and the breath of the almighty animated functionality (moveAbout(), reproduceAnother()) into man. That ended his physical involvement in creation (like shaping mud or extracting ribs). He charged them to be fruitful and multiply (make subclasses or instances) and these subclasses share same properties and functionality with the parent classes. However, there are certain traits/properties that are perculiar to these subclasses, which are not a derivative of the parent classes. these traits are the ones he encapsulated in them directly.
